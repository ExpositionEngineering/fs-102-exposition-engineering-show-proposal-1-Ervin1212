During my episode basically what i will be doing is talking to Mrs. Erin about how to get new colloge students to start there intrest or get a gist in finding what they want to do to so they can know what they want to do for there major then there profession and this is all on where Mrs.Erin starts you to guide you to be succeful because i know the earlier you know what you want to do is more than helpful excepcially as a freshman because from hearing from pears and people that are my elders they say the further you get into colloge without knowing what your there for is more than stressful because your so deep in. So as a freshman and being new to colloge knowing what you want to do is such a good start or even having a idea of what your intrested in is very good to a lead to your major and even your minor. 

During this episode im also gonna be asking Mrs. Erin how she helps freshmen or new colloge students how she helps them chose there mjor or even how she guides them with so many majors out there to chose from and how discipline it can be. What i mean by discpline is making these young studnets chose something that theyll be paying for even studying for usally for four whole years and thats a very big descion for someone to pick because this someones future and profession your helping them pick. Thats nothing to play with and as a teacher in her perspectie i would want to know how she does that for her students / new colloge studnets. 

This episode aslo will include on how students can chose how they can find the right people to go find that teahes there major or not even teach but also show them what its like and also show them the fields so they can see what its all about beofre getting themselves into what they dont know what there getting themselves into. thats what my episodes will be about. 

## üì¢ Call to Action

After, listening to my podcast i would like new colloge students to understand that the sooner you have a gist of what you would like to major in the next 4 years of your life will be more than helpful and less stressful and helps you get to them classes you need to take and you will already have a plan ahead of time youll be ahead of what you know you need to do. But, also its ok that if you dont know what you dont know what you would like to do there are people around to help just like my guest Mrs. Erin.
