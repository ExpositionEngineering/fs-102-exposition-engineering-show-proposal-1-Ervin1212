## üî¨ Show Details

- **Title**: Nothing Major
- **Host**: Ervin Myree
- **Guest**: Erin O'Day


## üìù Show Objectives

- **Objective One**: Helping new college students find what they want to do.

## üìö Sample Questions

Provide a list of at least three sample questions that the host will ask the guest.

Provide a justification for why asking this question will achieve one of the stated objectives for the podcast episode.

- **Question One**: New to college and finalizing what they would like to major in?
- **Question Two**: What made you choose your major, and what made you decide that this is meant for you?
- **Question Three**: When finding your major, do you know what your minor will be and why? What made you pick this minor and why was it in your interest?

- **Justification for Question One**: It is okay for people not to know what they want to do going into college, but it is very helpful to find out what you want to do when you get into college.
- **Justification for Question Two**: To help students/college students understand that finding their profession is important.  
- **Justification for Question Three**: Finding their major is very important, but also their minor is also something that should draw their interest as well.


## üéâ Show Description

During my episode, I will be talking to Mrs. Erin about how to get new college students to start their interest or get a gist of finding what they want to do, so they can know what they want to major in and their profession. This is all on where Mrs. Erin starts to guide you to be successful because I know the earlier you know what you want to do is more than helpful, especially as a freshman. Hearing from peers and people who are my elders, they say the further you get into college without knowing what you're there for is more than stressful because you're so deep in. So as a freshman and being new to college, knowing what you want to do is such a good start or even having an idea of what you're interested in is very good, leading to your major and even your minor.

During this episode, I'll also be asking Mrs. Erin how she helps freshmen or new college students, how she helps them choose their major or even how she guides them with so many majors out there to choose from and how discipline it can be. What I mean by discipline is making these young students choose something that they'll be paying for, usually for four whole years, and that's a very big decision for someone to pick because this is someone's future and profession you're helping them pick. That's nothing to play with, and as a teacher in her perspective, I would want to know how she does that for her students/new college students.

This episode will also include on how students can choose how they can find the right people to go find that teaches their major or not even teach but also show them what it's like and also show them the fields so they can see what it's all about before getting themselves into what they don't know what they're getting themselves into. That's what my episodes will be about.


## üì¢ Call to Action

After listening to my podcast, I would like new college students to understand that the sooner you have a gist of what you would like to major in, the next 4 years of your life will be more than helpful and less stressful, helping you get to those classes you need to take, and you will already have a plan ahead of time. You'll be ahead of what you know you need to do. But also, it's okay if you don't know what you would like to do. There are people around to help, just like my guest Mrs. Erin. After a person listens to this episode, what do you want them to do?
